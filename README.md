# National-Death-Index-Formatter

This code uses python, pandas, and juipter notebooks to reformat data from an excel file to be sent to the CDC's national death index (NDI). 
  For specific requirements from the NDI please see their user manual located at (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi/resources.htm).
The included data is randomly generated example data. The data used did not collect birth month and generates multiple searches for each participant for different months. Additional data about the participant may be included to match your data and change match accuracies.
